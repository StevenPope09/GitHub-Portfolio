# DWS2 Kanban Board

## Week 1
This week thus far I have gone through the videos online and set up all approriate add-ins to the project. 

- This week introduced some new concepts to development and with further research I will work through the assigned tasks.
- Write out markup for the site which refelcts the trello boards we used in previous courses.
- Establish baseline design utilizing CSS preprocessors
- Work with responsive design and understand the concepts of mobile first.

Updates to follow as work progresses.





Welcome to the starter repo for your Kanban board application ðŸš€!

You'll want to customize this readme file a bit to contain information about the project, but for now here is what you need to know to get set up:

## Installation

Make sure you have the following:

- Node (v12)
- NPM

From the root of this project run: `npm install`. This will pull in the dependencies needed for development.

## Usage

- `npm start`: This command will start up a local web server, open your default browser, and begin watching scss files for changes.
- `npm run build`: This command will only compile your scss files.

## Things to know

You can customize the structure of this project however you like. A base set of functionality has been provided to get you started. Make sure to familiarize yourself with what's going on in the `gulpfile.js`.
