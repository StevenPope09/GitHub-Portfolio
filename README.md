# DWS2 Kanban Board

## Week 1
This week thus far I have gone through the videos online and set up all approriate add-ins to the project. 

- This week introduced some new concepts to development and with further research I will work through the assigned tasks.
- Write out markup for the site which refelcts the trello boards we used in previous courses.
- Establish baseline design utilizing CSS preprocessors
- Work with responsive design and understand the concepts of mobile first.

Updates to follow as work progresses.

Week 1 was successful and the list items above were achieved. Moving forward I will correct and refactor my code from the feedback I was given(completed) and press on in my project.

## Week 2
This week we will be working with JavaScript to work with API data. We will also be working towards allowing our users to add new tasks to the list. As an optional parameter we have been given the challenge of allowing a user to edit/remove tasks as well. 

- Watch/read all of the materail given to us to complete these tasks
- Familarize myself with Fetch and how it works, also practice building API url strings used to call API data.
- Practice different techniques of interacting with the DOM to modify/add content via JS
- Build form to allow user input for new tasks
